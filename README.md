# Building Energy Management Toolkit - web application

This repository contains the web application version of a multi-sourced, data-driven toolkit for addressing building energy deficiencies and is open-source for others to learn from, adapt, and foster into more specialised versions of multi-sourced, data-driven toolkits. At this stage, the toolkit is undergoing active development. 
Additions and revisions are expected and the repository will be updated periodically to reflect the most recent changes.
